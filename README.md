# All for one one for All

This repository belongs to my master thesis in microdata analysis with an emphasis on business intelligence. It is in the area of artificial intelligence, and its methodology is based on neural networks and genetic algorithm. I have done it in the autumn semester of 2020, and the final report is available on the diva portal at the following link:

https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1525202/FULLTEXT01.pdf

Also, you can directly download it from the repository.

The folders follow the report's structure, and therefore if you read it (especially the second and third chapters), you will understand how they are organized. However, to make it easier for you, I have explained them briefly in the following table:


| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
